# Experiment-08- Encoders-and-decoders 
### AIM: To implement 8 to 3 Encoder and  3to8 Decoder using verilog and validate its outputs
### HARDWARE REQUIRED:  – PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher
### SOFTWARE REQUIRED:   Quartus prime
### THEORY 

## Encoders
Binary code of N digits can be used to store 2N distinct elements of coded information. This is what encoders and decoders are used for. Encoders convert 2N lines of input into a code of N bits and Decoders decode the N bits into 2N lines.

1. Encoders –
An encoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information in the form of a 2N input lines into N output lines, which represent N bit code for the input. For simple encoders, it is assumed that only one input line is active at a time.

As an example, let’s consider Octal to Binary encoder. As shown in the following figure, an octal-to-binary encoder takes 8 input lines and generates 3 output lines.

Implementation –

X = D4 + D5 + D6 + D7
Y = D2 +D3 + D6 + D7
Z = D1 + D3 + D5 + D7 
Hence, the encoder can be realised with OR gates as follows:

 ### Decoders 
A decoder does the opposite job of an encoder. It is a combinational circuit that converts n lines of input into 2n lines of output.

Let’s take an example of 3-to-8 line decoder.
Implementation –
D0 is high when X = 0, Y = 0 and Z = 0. Hence,

D0 = X’ Y’ Z’ 
Similarly,

D1 = X’ Y’ Z
D2 = X’ Y Z’
D3 = X’ Y Z
D4 = X Y’ Z’
D5 = X Y’ Z
D6 = X Y Z’
D7 = X Y Z
